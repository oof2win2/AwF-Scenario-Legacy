## All-Weekend Factorio

All-Weekend Factorio (often AwF) is a server hosting community with a strong focus on Factorio and games that follow similar ideas. Our Factorio server are known for hosting large maps with the main goal of being a "mega base" which can produce as much as possible within our reset schedule. Although these servers tend to attract the more experienced players, our servers are open to everyone. You can find us through our [discord](https://awf.yt), or in the public games tab in Factorio (AwF Regular, AwF Core etc)

## Use and Installation

1. Download this git repo for the stable release

2. Extract the downloaded zip file from the branch you downloaded into Factorio's scenario directory:

   - Windows: `%appdata%\Factorio\scenarios`
   - Linux: `~/.factorio/scenarios`

3. Within the scenario you can find `./config/_file_loader.lua` which contains a list of all the modules that will be loaded by the scenario; simply comment out (or remove) features you do not want but note that some modules may load other modules as dependencies even when removed from the list.

4. More advanced users may want to play with the other configs files within `./config` but please be aware that some of the config files will require a basic understanding of lua while others may just be a list of values.

5. Once you have made any config changes that you wish to make open Factorio, select play, then start scenario (or host scenario from within multiplayer tab), and select the scenario which will be called `scenario-master` if you have downloaded the latest stable release and have not changed the folder name.

6. The scenario will now load all the selected modules and start the map, any errors or exceptions raised in the scenario should not cause a game/server crash, so if any features do not work as expected then it may be returning an error in the log.
   Please report these errors to [the issues page](issues).
